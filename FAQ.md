### Why are your addons so ugly?

I am not a designer and i find CSS to be dedious/boring to a certain degree.
That said, anyone is welcome to make PRs / improvment suggestions.

### Why are the issue pages in your repositories disabled? 

At the moment i find it easier when everything is in one place. 
Should the number of collaboraters increases or something else change i might change this on a per project basis. 

### Can i use your stuff ? 

Sure, go ahead. If you plan an releasing something build with/on it into the public domain, 
it would be nice if you left a mention somewhere. Otherwise, have fun.
